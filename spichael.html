            <h3 id="centeredtext">Fun Facts</h3>
            <p><strong>Bio:</strong> Spichael has played SSBU for around two years. First presented to it on one of Water’s birthday
                parties, near the beginning of 2021 was when he started playing it seriously with his friends. Due to an interest in
                cartoons and animated characters, his main player is Toon Link, and is really the only character he plays. His
                nickname, in fact, was given to him because of a certain aspect of Link’s attacks. Formerly an underdog, he has
                improved in his fighting abilities, and is now a formidable foe to other competitors. </p>
            <p>
            <p>
                <strong>Notable Characteristics:</strong> Spichael retains a hit-and-run playstyle, along with military tactics;
                if there is a group, lob a bomb over. If people are distracted, throw a boomerang and an arrow or two in their
                general direction. If there is ample opportunity, he’ll aim his sword downward and spike anyone and everything.
                Not to mention, but since Toon Link is so short, any attacks with taller hitboxes are ineffective against him.
                Commentary is common in his fights.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Hobbies/Skills:</strong> Spichael is commonly drawing and writing stories in his free time. He is a published
                author and watches a lot of tank-related videos. He is interested in various stories and animations, and spends
                many minutes thinking of stories and events related to them. Currently, he is creating a comic of Toon Link and
                working on the visual aspects of his second novel.
