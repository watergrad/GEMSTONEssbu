            <h3 id="centeredtext">Fun Facts</h3>
            <p><strong>Bio:</strong> Greene is the literal definition of a Gamer. The elitest of elite, specializing in Nintendo.
            Of course, such a skill is accompanied with a fair bit of SSBU knowlege. Not to mention, but he worked on this website!
            What a guy!</p>
            <p>
            <p>
                <strong>Notable Characteristics:</strong> Extremely versatile in his skills. Amazing at pulling things out of the 
                back when you least expect them. Plays passive-agressively.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Hobbies/Skills:</strong> Greene's hobbies mostly include video games. However, he is a jack of all trades,
                so there is a lot more to say about him. Making tunes, arranging powerpoint presentations and websites, and indulging
                in similar creative projects are some of his other hobbies.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Favorite Color:</strong> Green (If you somehow didn't get that before, like, the other ones are obvious too
                but come ON).
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Favorite Video Games (that aren't SSBU:)</strong> I would love to, but... well... he has a LOT.
