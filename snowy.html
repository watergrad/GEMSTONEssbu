            <h3 id="centeredtext">Fun Facts</h3>
            <p><strong>Bio:</strong> Snowy was nearly the last to start playing the game starting with SSBU multiple years after it
                had been out. He has worked really hard to play his character to the best that he can. With all of his practice and
                motivation, even with his late start to everyone else, he has become one of the best. He worked really hard to gain
                this position, but he is not done yet. He believes he still has a long way to go, and that the best way to get better
                is to keep playing the game while getting advice from better players.</p>
            <p>
            <p>
                <strong>Notable Characteristics:</strong> Snowy looks primarily for Aerial Control, and will always capitalize on an opportunity to
                control the ledge. His main, King Dedede is really good at ledge traps as well as pressuring any recovery option.
                He has also worked hard on his neutral game because his character does not have the best neutral game play. Also,
                he's pretty tall, so it adds to the intimidation factor.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Hobbies/Skills:</strong> Snowy likes bowling as well as playing video games. He is really good at just
                about anything physical, which somehow including playing video games.
