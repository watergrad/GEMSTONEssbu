            <p><strong>Bio:</strong> CUL8R is Water's brother, who joined the team mainly because "why not?". He is a pretty solid
                player, his Smash journey beginning around 3 years ago with SSBU. He plays a lot of different characters and loves
                to play casually with wacky rulesets he makes himself. However, just because he is a casual player doesn't mean
                he is bad or anything. He was trained by some of the best on the team.</p>
