            <p>Hey there! If you are reading this, I can only assume that you are either one of us or curious about who we are.
        Well, to be frank, we are just some friends who enjoy playing Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. This is our website to track
        information about us. Everything is subject to change, and as long as Water (top local player and the person who is writing this)
        updates this page, you should be seeing the most recent data from everyone on the team. We are all about getting better, and if
        you wanna be a part of it, we are all in!</p>
        <p><em>If you would like to join our group, please contact Water at waterdrag567yt@gmail.com.</em></p>

        <p>Do you guys want a new domain name? I sure do! It is going to take some time, but eventually I plan to purchase an
            official domain name, so you dont have to use the github.io url. If you guys have any ideas for
            domain names, just contact me with the information above. - Water</p>

        <p>The suggestion of Jerseys is being considered! Not only would they be pretty freaking awesome, but they also might become
            eligible for a uniform option on Wednesdays at Gem Prep, Pocatello! Here is what you need to know (courtesy of Darkstorm):</p>
            <p>
                Possibilities: 
                School approved, 
                Personalized; have the mini-image of your main, 
                Stylized gaming GPP logo. 
                <br>
                Individual Requirements:
                HAVE A SOLID MAIN (This is for the style suggestion), 
                Try to have almost nothing extra, 
                Personal payments/(80%?)
                <br>
                Initial suggestion:
                    Black with blue accents, stylized gaming GPP logo, (nick)name and number on back, polo for school approval. Have your main on it.
