            <h3 id="centeredtext">Fun Facts</h3>
            <p><strong>Bio:</strong> Potato is Vasser's cousin. He live about 150 miles away from anyone else on the team, which
                is why he is here in the honorable mentions. Potato has been playing SSBU for a while, and has even played SSBB.
                His career really picked up when Vasser's did, and they have learned their skills together.</p>
            <p>
            <p>
                <strong>Notable Characteristics:</strong> Plays meme characters and somehow wins with them. His playstyle is similar
                to Vasser's, as the upbringing of their careers were similar. If he can, he will prioritize a counterattack rather than
                a more defensive strategy.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Hobbies/Skills:</strong> Potato does a lot of things. I could write them down, but it is funner if you ask him
                about it. Funner for me because I dont have to ask him, and funner for you because he is a cool guy!
