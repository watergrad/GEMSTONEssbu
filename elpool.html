            <p><strong>Bio:</strong> Elpool's Super Smash Bros. journey began with Smash 4. Since then, Elpool has started playing
                Smash Ultimate, seriously playing within in the last year. Elpool has changed his main from Sm4sh, which was Cloud,
                to Sephiroth, as he is very interested in the game FFVII. So far, Elpool has been close to winning a local tournament
                but his friends beat him before he could and the close, but still getting 3rd place. He has decided to improve his skills
                so that doesn't happen next time. Elpool can beat his friends on a good day, and can get wins back to back against Water and Snowy,
                who funnily enough are his teammates on team Pearl.</p>
            <p>
            <p>
                <strong>Notable Characteristics:</strong> Aggressive playstyle and usually uses specials. Edgegaurds sometimes.
                Always going for the sheild breaks, so hope you can mash faster than a Sephiroth Gigaflare. Sometimes gets riled up and
                blames his controllers for his losses. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Hobbies/Skills:</strong> Elpool enjoys writing and making music in his spare time. He is right now creating a book
                starring his origional character, who of course is Elpool.
