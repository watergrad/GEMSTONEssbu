            <h3 id="centeredtext">Fun Facts</h3>
            <p><strong>Bio:</strong> Water has been playing Smash Bros. since 2017, way back when Sm4sh was still a thing. He sucked a lot,
                though. He started playing SSBU in 2019, a while after the games realease. Ever since he took off the training
                wheels (a.k.a. Kirby up-b), he started maining Ness out of love for the game Earthbound
                (not to mention his love for easy yet stylish combos). He still thinks he is the best player in the group.
                Don't worry, just give him a few more tourneys.</p>
            <p>
            <p>
                <strong>Notable Characteristics:</strong> Agressive playstyle, always looking for combo starters (which sometimes means
                spamming PK fire), blames his controller a LOT, watches a lot of SSBU content on YouTube, has a large brain
                (he coded this website, after all,) and has an addiction to copious amounts of sugar, more specifically,
                discontinued Mountain Dew.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Hobbies/Skills:</strong> Water likes to make and produce his own music (spare yourself, it's not impeccable),
                play the piano and drums, code programs and websites, draw pictures, write essays and fiction, and go to the bowling
                alley with Snowy and Almyr. He likes to talk and study religion and politics, too, but like, thats <em>boring</em>.
